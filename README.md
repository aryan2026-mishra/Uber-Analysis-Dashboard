The Uber Analysis Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project built using Power BI, designed to uncover meaningful insights from Uber ride data. The dashboard is divided into three key pages. The Overview page provides a high-level summary of total rides, revenue, drivers, and average fares with clear KPIs and overall trends. The Time Analysis page focuses on demand patterns by hour, day, and month, highlighting peak hours and comparing weekday versus weekend rides to support better driver allocation and surge pricing strategies. The Detail page offers a deep dive into pickup and drop-off locations, top routes, and demand hotspots, with drill-through functionality for trip-level exploration. The project includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to ensure accuracy and clarity. With interactive filters and user-friendly design, the dashboard enables stakeholders to explore ride behavior dynamically. Key insights from the analysis show that demand peaks during evenings and weekends, certain pickup zones generate the highest number of rides, and revenue trends strongly align with time-based demand fluctuations. This project demonstrates the value of data storytelling and analytics in driving operational and business decisions.
